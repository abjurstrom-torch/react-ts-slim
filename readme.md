## FAQ

### Why not use create-react-app?

CRA is great at some things, but it is massive. As an example the CRA `webpack.config.js` file is 760 lines long and you can't edit it without opting completely out of the system. This project has a `webpack.config.js` that is 21 lines. Yes CRA does a lot, but it comes with a cost.
